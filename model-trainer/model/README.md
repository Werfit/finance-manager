# Model

There are 2 models here: **XG Boost** and **Light GBM**. Both of them work relatively similar in terms of accuracy, but **XG Boost** works a lot faster (pretty sure I've done something wrong somewhere).

| Model Name | Time    | MAE   | RMSE  |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| XG Boost   | 2m 53s  | ~1637 | ~8064 |
| Light GBM  | 23m 16s | ~1698 | ~8336 |

As you can see from **Light GBM** execution time, I wouldn't recommend running it ðŸ¥²

### Goal

The final goal of the model is to take some information from a user (his transaction history or maybe statistics of their expenses) and give a prediction on how much the user is going to spend on a category the next month.

### Datasets

There are 2 datasets: **final.csv** and **processed.csv**. The first one is the list of all transactions. The **dataset-processor.py** (you can run it with `uv run dataset-processor.py`) script reads the **final.csv** file (which is the same as from **/model-trainer/database/datasets/final-without-timestamp.csv**) and creates **processed.csv**.

Both of the models work only with **processed.csv**. It is a list of grouped by _category_, _month_ and _user_id_. The processing script also calculates sums amount the spent amount, amount spent on a category the previous month and average sum spent on a category throughout last 3 months.
